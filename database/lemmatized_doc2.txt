in the study of high - speed viscous flow past a two - dimensional body it be usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emit from the nose or leading edge of the body .   consequently , there exist an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .   such a situation arise , for instance , in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .   the situation be somewhat different from prandtl 's classical boundary - layer problem . in prandtl 's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer be irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary - layer problem the inviscid free stream must be consider as rotational .   the possible effect of vorticity have be recently discuss by ferri and libby .   in the present paper , the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity be investigate .   it can be show that this problem can again be treat by the boundary - layer approximation , the only novel feature be that the free stream have a constant vorticity .   the discussion here be restrict to two - dimensional incompressible steady flow .
