   an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream be make in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angle of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratio .   the result be intend in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatment of this problem .    the comparative span loading curve , together with support evidence , show that a substantial part of the lift increment produce by the slipstream be due to a /destalling/ or boundary - layer - control effect .   the integrate remain lift increment , after subtract this destalle lift , be find to agree well with a potential flow theory .    an empirical evaluation of the destalle effect be make for the specific configuration of the experiment .
