there be in supersonic aerodynamic many situation of practical interest wherein stream of different velocity and , in general , different stagnation pressure mix with one another . in the majority of these problem the interaction between the two stream take place in the presence of an axial pressure gradient .   its effect on the characteristic of the mixing may influence significantly the performance of the device wherein the phenomenon cite above occur .   a theoretical and experimental program of research to study mixing in the presence of axial pressure gradient be be carry on at the polytechnic institute of brooklyn .
