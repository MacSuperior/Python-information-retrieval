   it will be show that the differential equation for a heated plate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate at constant temperature can be make the same by a proper modification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate . this fact lead to the result that the stress in the heated plate can be calculate from measured strain on the unheated plate by a series of relation , call the /similarity law ./   the application of this analog theory to solid wing under aerodynamic heating be discuss in detail .   the loading on the unheated analog wing be , however , complicated and involve the novel concept of feedback and /body force/ loading .   the problem of stress a heated box - wing structure can be solve by the same analog method and be briefly discuss .
