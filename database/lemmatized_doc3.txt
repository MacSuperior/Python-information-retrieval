   in a recent contribution to the reader ' forum wassermann give analytic solution for the temperature in a double layer slab , with a triangular heat rate input at one face , insulate at the other , and with no thermal resistance at the interface .   his solution be for the three particular case .. I propose here to give the general solution to this problem , to indicate briefly how it be obtain use the method of reference 2 , and to point out that the solution give by wassermann be incomplete for time long than the duration of the heat input .
