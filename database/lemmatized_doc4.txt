   experiment be perform in the 12 - in . supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of three - dimensional roughness element ( sphere ) on boundary - layer transition on a tained at local mach number of 1.90 , 2.71 , and 3.67 by vary trip size , position , spacing , and reynold number per inch . the result indicate that ( 1 ) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induce by three - dimensional roughness element begin when the double row of spiral vortex trail each element contaminate and break down the surround field of vorticity , ( 2 ) transition appear rather suddenly , become more violent with increase roughness height relative to the boundary - layer thickness , ( 3 ) after the breakdown of the vorticity field , the strength of the spiral vortex may still persist in the sublayer of the ensue turbulent flow , ( 4 ) lateral spacing of roughness element have little effect upon the initial breakdown ( contamination ) of the laminar flow , and ( 5 ) the trip reynold number where u and v be the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of the boundary layer and k be roughness height , such that transition occur at the roughness position , vary as the position reynold number to the one - fourth power , viz . , where x be trip position .
