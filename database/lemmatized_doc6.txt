   an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated flat plate , 5 by 26 in . , be make in the galcit 5 by 5 in . hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .    the phosphorescent lacquer technique be use for transition detection and be find to be in good agreement with total - head rake measurement along the plate surface and pitot boundary- layer survey .   it be find that the boundary layer be laminar at reynolds number of at least 5 x 10 .   transverse contamination cause by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originate far downstream of the flat plate lead edge at reynolds number of 1.5 to 2 x 10 , and spread at a uniform angle of 5 compare to 9 degree in low - speed flow .    the effect of two - dimensional and local disturbance be investigate .   the technique of air injection into the boundary layer as a means of hastening transition be extensively use . although the onset of transition occur at reynold number as low as 10 , a fully develop turbulent boundary layer be not obtain at reynold number much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air inject .    a qualitative discussion of these result be give with emphasis on the possibility of a great stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at low speed .    direct skin - friction measurement be make by mean of the float element technique , over a range of reynolds number verify as be laminar over the complete range .   with air injection , turbulent shear be obtain only for reynold number great than 2 x 10 , this value be in good agreement with early result of this investigation .   the turbulent skin - friction coefficient be find to be approximately 0.40 of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r , and 0.46 for an effective reynold number between 5 and 6 x 10 .
