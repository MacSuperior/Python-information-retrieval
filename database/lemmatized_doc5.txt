in his study of the effect of roughness on transition , h. l. dryden find , on the basis of available datum , that the effect of a two - dimensional roughness element such as a /trip wire/ could be represent reasonably well in term of a functional relation between and , where be the reynolds number of transition base on distance from the lead edge , be the height of the roughness element , and be the boundary - layer displacement thickness at the position of the element .   at his suggestion some additional datum be obtain , primarily to extend the range to high value of , during the course of an investigation of transition on a flat plate conduct at the national bureau of standard .   after the result on the two- dimensional roughness element be obtain , it appear to be desirable to see whether a row of three - dimensional roughness element would behave in the same way .
