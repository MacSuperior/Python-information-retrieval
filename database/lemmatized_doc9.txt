   the dominate factor in structural design of high - speed aircraft be thermal and aeroelastic in origin .   the subject matter be concern largely with a discussion of these factor and their interrelation with one another .   a summary be present of some of the analytical and experimental tool available to aeronautical engineer to meet the demand of high - speed flight upon aircraft structure .   the state of the art with respect to heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure , mode of failure under combine load as well as thermal input and acrothermoelasticity be discuss .   method of attack and alleviate structural and aeroelastic problem of high - speed flight be summarize .   finally , some avenue of fundamental research be suggest .
