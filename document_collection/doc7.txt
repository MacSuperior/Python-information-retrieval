Abstract
The First Punic War (264â€“241 bc) was a series of land and sea campaigns fought between the Roman republic and Carthage, primarily for the control of Sicily. Rome, traditionally a land power, was forced to contend with Carthage for control of the sea; building and rebuilding several fleets, Rome won a series of naval victories that eventually established it as the leading maritime power in the Mediterranean. By 241, both sides were exhausted, and Carthage agreed to evacuate Sicily in return for peace; Rome was in no state itself to extract further concessions. In the aftermath of the conflict, the mercenary forces of Carthage rebelled; initially refusing to take advantage of the chaos, the Senate later intervened to seize Corsica and Sardinia. An impotent Carthage was forced to seek new opportunities in Spain, leading to new tensions and ultimately a new war with Rome.
